# ðŸŽ¨ Bootstyle

Bootstyle is a design framework for React Native. The library is inspired by Bootstrap and tries to bring best practices from the Sass/Css world to JavaScript. For that Bootstyle extends the React Native stylesheet object, so that it is possible to define variables, hover/focus/active states and media queries.

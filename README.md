# ðŸŽ¨ Bootstrap RN

Bootstrap RN is a design framework for React Native. The library is inspired by Bootstrap and tries to bring best practices from the Sass/Css world to JavaScript. For that Bootstrap RN extends the React Native stylesheet object, so that it is possible to define variables, hover/focus/active states and media queries.
